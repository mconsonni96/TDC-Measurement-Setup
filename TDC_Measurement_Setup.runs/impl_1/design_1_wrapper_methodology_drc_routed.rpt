XDCB-6#1 Advisory
Timing constraint pointing to hierarchical pins  
A timing constraint 'set_false_path' has a single -through that points to hierarchical pins (see constraint position '69' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). With such constraint, it is recommended to have a DONT_TOUCH or KEEP_HIERARCHY on the hierarchical module to avoid the risk of pin names changing during synthesis.
